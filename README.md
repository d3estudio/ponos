# Ponos ðŸ”¨

**Ponos** schedules ActiveJob tasks based on a Cron model

## Installing

Ponos is distributed as a Docker image:

```
docker pull victorgama/ponos:latest
```

The image requires a configuration file to be available in `/app/ponos.toml`,
and a connection to your local Redis server used by Sidekiq (or any other task
runner)

## Configuring

Below is a sample `ponos.toml` configuration:

```toml
# This file is used to configure and set Ponos' schedule
# Please do keep in mind that Ponos does not use the regular
# crontab format as expressed in the next diagram:
#
#    *  *  *  *  *
#    |  |  |  |  \_> Day of Week (0-6)
#    |  |  |  \_> Month (0-12)
#    |  |  \_> Day of Month (0-31)
#    |  \_> Hour (0-23)
#    \_> Minute (0-59)
#
# Ponos contains an extra field representing seconds, as expressed below:
#    *  *  *  *  *  *
#    |  |  |  |  |  \_> Day of Week (0-6)
#    |  |  |  |  \_> Month (1-12)
#    |  |  |  \_> Day of Month (1-31)
#    |  |  \_> Hour (0-23)
#    |  \_> Minute (0-59)
#    \_> Second (0-59)
#

driver = 'sidekiq-activejob'

[redis]
url = 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1'

[schedule]
    [schedule.notify_rejected_refunds]
    period = '* * * * * *'
    job =    'TestJob'
```

Currently, the only driver available is `sidekiq-activejob`, which enqueues jobs
to Sidekiq using structures generated by ActiveJob. The driver requires a
`redis` section to be defined with a `url` key.

`schedule` represents the schedule Ponos will execute. Inside it we find
subsections representing each job, and its properties:

- `period`: Required. Determines when the job will be enqueued
- `job`: Required. Name of the Job, just as implemented in your application.
- `retry`: Optional. Determines whether or not the job should be retried in case
of errors. Default: `false`
- `queue`: Optional. Name of the queue in which this job is executed. Default:
`"default"`

> **Protip**: The subsection name identifies the job inside Ponos and must be
unique.
